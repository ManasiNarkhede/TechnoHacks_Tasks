<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
A standard Python installation is required. There’s no need to create a virtual environment because no external dependency is required. The only package that you’ll need is Tkinter, which comes with the Python standard library.

However, you need to make sure that you have the right Tkinter version installed. You should have Tkinter greater than or equal to 8.6. Otherwise, your game won’t work.

You can check your current Tkinter version by starting a Python interactive session and running the following code:

If this code doesn’t show a version greater than or equal to 8.6 for your Tkinter installation, then you’ll need to fix that.

On Ubuntu Linux, you may need to install the python3-tk package using the system’s package manager, apt. That’s because typically Ubuntu doesn’t include Tkinter in its default Python installation.

Once you have Tkinter properly installed, then you need to check its current version. If the Tkinter version is lower than 8.6, then you’ll have to install a more recent version of Python.

On macOS and Windows, a straightforward option is to install a Python version greater than or equal to 3.9.8 from the download page.

Once you’re sure you have the right Tkinter version, you can get back to your compiler and start writing code.
