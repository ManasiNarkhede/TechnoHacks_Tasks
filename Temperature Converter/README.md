<h1>Temperature converter</h1>

Temperature measurements are critical for effective data analysis and interpretation in everything from weather forecasting to material research. 

A temperature converter helps convert the temperature between Fahrenheit , Celsius and Kelvin scale. 

While Kelvin (K) is the SI unit of temperature, people generally use Centigrade or Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) to measure temperature. 

The temperature converter formula is used for conversion of between temperatures.

As a result, having an effective and easy-to-use temperature converter calculator is necessary for both professionals and students.

After entering the temperature in either of the units(Farenheit,Celcius,Kelvin) click on "Go" button for conversion of temperature from one unit to other.

Exit button is used to exit the GUI.
