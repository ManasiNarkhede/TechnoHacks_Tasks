<h1>Tic Tac Toe Game</h1>

Tic Tac Toe is one of the most played games and is the best time killer game that you can play.

The tic-tac-toe game is for two players. One player plays X and the other plays O. 

The players take turns placing their marks on a grid of three-by-three cells. 

If a given player gets three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, then that player wins the game. 

The game will be tied if no one gets three in a row by the time all the cells are marked.

The restart button restarts the game.

Here, Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O.
